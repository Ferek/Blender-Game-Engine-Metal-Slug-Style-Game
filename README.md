# Blender Game Engine-Metal Slug Style Game
Basic mechanics of a Metal Slug style game, made in the Logic Bricks Editor of the Blender Game Engine

The first time i hear about Blender Game Engine i thought that was only to python programmers but a time ago i decided to give it a try. The results were more than i expected.

No python needed, I only used Logic Bricks. Hope this helps someone to understand a bit more the logic bricks editor.
